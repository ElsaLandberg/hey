        Specific ”research objective” and context- determining whether some set of variables are specific for ”developing countries” versus ”developed countries”. Distribution of  countries (10 developed and 10 developing) based on this (http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf) classification from the UN.

        This is a screenshot of how WVS’ visualisation tool looks like. According to my overarching research objective (compare ”developed” countries to ”developing” countries), I would want a tool where it is possible to group the replies into one cluster of ”developing” countries, and one cluster with ”developed” countries. This also only shows one wave at a time (above is a screenshot from wave 2010-2014). Analysis of this visualisation (tool)Important variables: wave, Therefore, I will create a visualisation where it is moPlan for D3 visualisation (but illustrated through excel instead) I would create a D3 visualisation tool where I could
